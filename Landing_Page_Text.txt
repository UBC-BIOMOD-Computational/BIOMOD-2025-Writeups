What does the P-Gel Do?
P-Gel stands for 'Protein-producing Gel'.

The P-Gel system:
1.) Contains and protects transcriptional units of a gene of interest
2.) Localizes transcription of genes into mRNA for efficiency
3.) Allows for translation of mRNA into the protein of interest

Why Use a P-Gel?
Protein yield in cellular systems is limited by energy losses from nonspecific side reactions.

Our P-gel system may yield more because of:
1.) Specific gene expression
2.) Gene protection
3.) Reusable system and longer expression time
